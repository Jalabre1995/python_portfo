                  <h3>Just guy that wants to spread his love for coding, AI, Python, and building toy robots to everyone.</h3>
                  <p>I didn't get into coding until I graduated from college in 2018. I took the normal route. Go to college and major in Business. I thought that was my wa out. But I didn't know what I want to do with my business degree. Then a year ago, as I was playing Final Fantasy, I noticed my friend coding for a hackerthon competiton. I was very interested in how he was manipulating the data to make it his own. I looked confused, but at the same time curious. </p>
                  <h3>Before Coding </h3>
                  <p>Just another lost puppy that wanted to find meaning to life. Not sure where my life was taking me. My love for robots, AI, and coding was a tiny flame that didn't ignite at all through high school and college. I wanted to fit in and be like everyone else. I wanted to be an accountant. And don't get me wrong, I am not bashing any accountants out there. You guys are strong building blcoks to this community, but I didn't like what I was doing. I was bored. A mindless zombie you may add. When I thought back to the time I saw my frind codding, thats when the fire inside me came back to life. I dropped being an accountant, and focus so much of my time building toy robots and coding. 
                  <h3>Hobbies and Goals</h3>
                  <p>
                  What I love to do outside of coding is build robotic cars and toy figures. I also play guitar and train for half marathons.</p>
